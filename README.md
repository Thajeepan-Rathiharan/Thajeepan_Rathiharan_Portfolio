# Welcome to my portfolio
- This is my updated portfolio that took me a few weeks to make and I am proud of it.

## Why I update my portfolio
- I updated my portfolio with a new layout to showcase more projects I make, so I can show people who look at my CV my most recent projects.
- I will be using this updated portfolio on both my CV and LinkedIn to use to apply for Front End Developer jobs.
